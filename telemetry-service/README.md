### Description:
The **Telemetry Service** is a critical component of the Clever Village System. It processes telemetry 
and event data generated by user equipment and sensors. This service is designed to ensure system reliability by managing emergency shutdowns, 
registering new house connections, and storing telemetry data for monitoring and analytics. Through Kafka-based communication 
and integration with other services like `DeviceService`, it enables efficient event-driven workflows and data synchronization.

### Telemetry service for receiving events from equipment:
The telemetry service is responsible for processing events from equipment and sensors, 
as well as interacting with `DeviceService` via HTTP to manage devices.

### Logic for processing emergency module shutdown events:
1. **Emergency situation**: During equipment operation, predefined situations may occur, such as overheating, excessively high or low temperatures, module malfunctions, etc.
2. **Receiving an emergency shutdown event**: When an emergency event is published to the corresponding topic, the telemetry service sends an HTTP request to DeviceService to initiate the emergency shutdown of the equipment.
3. **Saving the event**: Events related to emergency module shutdowns are stored in MongoDB for further analysis and auditing.

### Logic for processing events of connecting a new home to the system:
1. **Connecting a new home to the system**: When setting up a new home to work with the smart home system, the equipment service sends an event to Kafka. This allows the telemetry service to account for the new connection.
2. **Event saving**: events about connecting a new home are stored in MongoDB to update the system's state.  

### Logic for processing telemetry events:
1. **Event generation**: during system operation, all equipment in users' homes sends telemetry data to Kafka, recording its current state and performance.
2. **Event saving**: telemetry events are stored in MongoDB for subsequent monitoring and analysis.
